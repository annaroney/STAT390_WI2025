Case Tissue Slide Matching - Assigned Cases 04-06

Case 04 - All slices were very similar.

Case 05: The melan scan, while posessing similar shapes, was not matching in the angular positioning of its 'head'. The sox10 scan was not matching in its 'tail'. The h&e shared traits of both.

Case 06: The sox10 was only similar in that it was an elongated shape with similar thicknesses as the other two scan. Most of its distinct shapes and curves were not matching.

Both cases 05 and 06 were assessed for extraction thresholds. Both were extracted appropriately and clearly, these appear to be genuine mismatches.
