I worked on Case 25-30 from Sheffield. 

Case 25 was the only one that posed a problem as the pre-processed tissue slices were not extracted properly. The original stains had two tissue slices formatted back-to-back very closely. Cara's automated code's default merging threshold was too high, so I edited that value to prevent this issue. 

The edited line of code is this one right here: double distanceThreshold = 5000.0 

Other than that, I just had to watch out for orientation when matching the three sets of stain types.
