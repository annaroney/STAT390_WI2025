Week 1:

Assigned Cases 19-24:

19: Sox10 scan did not match any of the other scans.
20: Original match2 was not the best match; replaced the H&E scan with a better option.
21: Initially had only 1 scan for melan. Went back to the original data file and extracted the missing scan. Using the new melan scan, found a match.
22: Folder contained 12 H&E scans, plus extra melan and sox10 scans. Rotated scans and identified 2 total matches.
23: Good as is.
24: Folder included 12 H&E scans and multiple melan/sox10 scans. Sox10 scans did not match any others; marked as unmatched.

Assisted with rearranging data to send to stakeholders for annotation.
