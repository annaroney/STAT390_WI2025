I completed the task for Cases 62 and 63 for Copenhagen.

Case 62 only had one slice per stain, therefore only requiring a simple crop.

Case 63 also had no issues, though this one had seven matches total. Initially, I used Cara's code, which was fairly effective in capturing the more obvious slices. I then had to manually trace the ones her code had missed, as well as split one of the annotations into three different stains.
